-- Analytics Framework: Retention in AB Test Funnel

-- Purpose:
-- A lot of AB-tests done in the product ideally should convert to better retention.
-- Letâ€™s add a D7 retention rate to the AB-test funnel.

-- Approach:
-- 1. Start with a query that gives us a cohort of the user.
-- 2. LEFT JOIN any data we need.
-- 3. Use subqueries to break down calculation logic.
-- 4. Group and count or sum.
-- 5. Answer

-- Steps:
-- 1. Calculating retention rate per user
-- 2. Adding D7 retention rate to AB-test funnel
